# YaDal - yet another data access layer

In a nutshell, this library is
- a light-weight Fluent API for ADO.Net
- small enough
- designed to help you get rid of the DBNull.Value mess, as well as the overall ADO.Net cruft
- NOT an ORM

To use it, you can use nuget (install-package Net.Code.AdoNet), or just drop the Db.cs file in your project.

For more information and examples, see the [wiki](https://github.com/jhgbrt/yadal/wiki).
